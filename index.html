        <p class="info">Here are some super quick and easy recipes that are perfect for meal preppers. Most of these recipes will be as simple as throwing everything together and cooking or vice-versa. I will try to keep them to 10 steps or less. I like simple. I was tired of all the long-winded explanations and backgrounds on every recipe site. This is meant to be a quick and concise reference for the modern man who is frequently on the go. I'll be honest...I'm really lazy when it comes to cooking so if I am going to get all the calories I need in a day, it has to be simple. That was the inspiration for this collection of the best recipes for meal prep I could find. Aside from this paragraph, I will be as quick and to the point as possible so you can spend less time reading and cooking and more time hitting the gym and living your best life. I hope you enjoy!</p>
