            <p>These buffalo chicken taquitos/flautas are just as delicious as they are easy to make. This recipe will make 10-12, depending on how many tortillas come in the pack you buy. You can adjust the buffalo sauce for spice/flavor and adjust the cheese to chicken ratio depending on your needs for the day. Some days my diet lacks fats so I have to make it a point to add some in a somewhat healthy way. This is one example of how I accomplish that. you could always get bigger tortillas and add in some rice and beans and top it with some veggies if you are wanting a quick but satisfying flavor excursion. Possibilities are endless with this one and the flavor is phenomenal! Enjoy!</p>
