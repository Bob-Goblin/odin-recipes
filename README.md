# odin-recipes
Odin Project recipe project.

First public repository on Github. First working experience with Git workflow. 
Project highlights current KSAs regarding HTML and basic build structure.
 
Contents will include index page, link to stylesheet to be develped at undetermined future date, links to a currently undetermined number of recipes or mock recipes, and possibly more as project requires. Developer is attempting to trust the process and not go overboard on this first assignment as instructions were given to avoid wormholes. 

Project shall highlight KSAs: basic understanding html concepts including but not limited to anchors, links, images, navigation, forms and form inputs. Basic knowledge of version control workflow and development collaboration platforms such as Git and Github. 

This will not be beautiful to start; however, it is called development for a reason. Thank you if you have taken the time to read this and check out my work. I hope to one day do this in a more serious manner.
